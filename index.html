    <h2>Unit 3 — Section A — (5 × 2 = 10 marks)</h2>
    <p><em>(Each answer ~2–3 lines; straight to the point)</em></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>What are the principles of biomedical ethics?</strong><br>
        Four core principles: <strong>Autonomy</strong> (respect patient’s choices), <strong>Beneficence</strong> (act in patient’s best interest), <strong>Non-maleficence</strong> (do no harm), <strong>Justice</strong> (fair distribution of healthcare/resources). These guide clinical decisions and professional conduct.
      </li>
      <hr>
      <li>
        <strong>What is a near-miss event?</strong><br>
        A near-miss is an incident that could have caused harm but did not reach the patient due to timely interception or chance (e.g., wrong drug picked but detected before administration). It’s a warning sign for system weaknesses.
      </li>
      <hr>
      <li>
        <strong>What are sentinel events?</strong><br>
        Sentinel events are unexpected events causing serious harm or death (e.g., wrong-site surgery, severe medication error). They require immediate investigation and root-cause analysis.
      </li>
      <hr>
      <li>
        <strong>What is purpose and coverage of professional indemnity insurance policy?</strong><br>
        Purpose: protect a healthcare professional financially against claims of negligence or malpractice. Coverage typically includes legal defence costs, settlements/judgments up to policy limits, and sometimes regulatory investigation costs (subject to exclusions).
      </li>
      <hr>
      <li>
        <strong>What is MLC?</strong><br>
        MLC = Medico-Legal Case — any case with legal implications (e.g., assault, RTA, poisoning, suspicious death). It requires special documentation, preservation of evidence, and reporting to legal/forensic authorities.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <hr>
    <h3>Section B — (4 × 18 = 72 marks)</h3>
    <p><em>(Each answer concise, structured, and exam-oriented)</em></p>

    <h4>1. Explain near-miss events. (18 marks)</h4>
    <p><strong>Definition & difference:</strong> A near-miss is an occurrence that could have resulted in patient harm but was averted. Unlike adverse events (which cause harm), near-misses signal latent system flaws.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> wrong medication selected but intercepted, intended imaging order not transmitted but detected, patient ID mismatch discovered before procedure.</p>
    <p><strong>Causes:</strong> human error, poor communication, unclear protocols, labeling/packaging issues, staffing/workload pressures, equipment failures.</p>
    <p><strong>Importance of reporting:</strong> Reporting near-misses uncovers system vulnerabilities without the consequence of actual harm; increases safety culture; prevents recurrence.</p>
    <p><strong>Investigation & response:</strong> Use non-punitive reporting; perform root-cause analysis (RCA); identify contributing factors; design corrective actions (process redesign, alerts, checklists).</p>
    <p><strong>Prevention strategies:</strong> standardise procedures, enforce double-checks (e.g., two-person drug checks), improve handovers, staff training, electronic barcoding/EMR safeguards, regular audits and feedback.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome measures:</strong> reduced incidents, improved reporting rates, implemented corrective actions verified by follow-up audits.</p>
    <p><em>(For exam: give one succinct RCA step and one example of a system fix for full credit.)</em></p>

    <hr>
    <h4>2. Explain in detail about MLC including maintaining records, its types, confidentiality and release of medical information. What is procedure for receiving MLC? (18 marks)</h4>

    <p><strong>Definition & types:</strong> MLC = Medico-Legal Case. Common types: homicidal/assault cases, suicidal attempts, accidental injuries (RTA), poisoning/overdose, sexual assault/rape, burn injuries, suspicious/unexplained deaths.</p>

    <p><strong>Initial procedure on receipt (stepwise):</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Immediate medical care</strong> — stabilise patient irrespective of legal status.</li>
      <li><strong>Preserve evidence</strong> — avoid altering wounds, collect clothing, swabs, label and store specimens with chain-of-custody.</li>
      <li><strong>Document meticulously</strong> — time/date, detailed history (in patient’s words if possible), physical findings, photos (with consent where allowed), injuries mapped.</li>
      <li><strong>Notify authorities</strong> — inform hospital medico-legal officer/police as per rules.</li>
      <li><strong>MLC form/registration</strong> — register as MLC in hospital records; prepare reports for police/forensic department.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent & counselling</strong> — obtain consent for procedures; inform about legal reporting obligations.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Maintaining records:</strong> Use standardized MLC proformas; record identity, circumstances, clinical notes, investigations, chain of custody, photos, signatures of examining doctor; maintain secure, time-stamped copies; retain for legally mandated period (hospital policy/legal guidelines).</p>

    <p><strong>Confidentiality & release of information:</strong> Medical confidentiality is fundamental, but MLCs are an exception—certain information must be shared with police or court on lawful order. Release only on written request from competent authority (police, court) or with patient’s informed consent. Disclose minimum necessary data, maintain copies of requests and releases. Unauthorized disclosure is punishable.</p>

    <p><strong>Key legal/ethical points:</strong> Treat patient clinically first, document objectively, avoid leading language, preserve evidence, follow institutional/legal protocols.</p>

    <hr>
    <h4>3. Discuss importance of standardized protocol in healthcare to prevent sentinel events. (18 marks)</h4>

    <p><strong>Definition & purpose:</strong> Standardized protocols are evidence-based, stepwise procedures (checklists, guidelines, order sets) that reduce variation in care and ensure critical safety steps are performed. Their purpose is to minimise human error and prevent catastrophic sentinel events.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples effective against sentinel events:</strong> WHO surgical safety checklist (pre-op verification, time-out), medication reconciliation at admission/discharge, barcoding for meds, central line insertion bundle, handoff/ISBAR communication protocol.</p>

    <p><strong>How protocols prevent sentinel events:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce variability so routine tasks include safety checks (prevents wrong-site/wrong-patient procedures).</li>
      <li>Force critical verifications (ID checks, consent, allergy status).</li>
      <li>Standardise communication during handovers to avoid information loss.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Implementation strategies:</strong> leadership commitment, multidisciplinary development, staff training and simulation, integrate into workflow (EMR order sets), visual prompts, appoint champions, continuous monitoring.</p>

    <p><strong>Monitoring & improvement:</strong> track compliance, audit outcomes, perform root-cause analyses for breaches, use Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles to refine protocols.</p>

    <p><strong>Barriers & solutions:</strong> resistance to change (engage staff), workflow mismatch (pilot test), incomplete adherence (feedback, accountability).</p>

    <p><strong>Impact evidence:</strong> standard protocols consistently reduce surgical errors, medication errors, central line infections, and deaths — and create a culture of safety.</p>

    <p><em>(For answers: mention one specific protocol and one metric to show effect.)</em></p>

    <hr>
    <h4>4. Explain in detail about biomedical principles. (18 marks)</h4>

    <p><strong>Core principles (Beauchamp & Childress):</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Autonomy</strong> — respect patient’s right to make informed decisions; requires informed consent and disclosure of options/risks.</li>
      <li><strong>Beneficence</strong> — act to benefit the patient; balance potential benefits of interventions.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-maleficence</strong> — avoid causing harm; weigh risks vs benefits and minimise iatrogenic harm.</li>
      <li><strong>Justice</strong> — fair allocation of resources and impartial treatment.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Supporting ethical duties:</strong> Veracity (truthfulness), Confidentiality (protect patient information), Fidelity (keeping commitments), Duty of care.</p>

    <p><strong>Application in physiotherapy/BPT context:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Informed consent before treatment plans (explain goals, techniques, alternatives).</li>
      <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> respect refusal of painful procedures; offer alternatives.</li>
      <li><strong>Beneficence & non-maleficence:</strong> choose evidence-based modalities to improve function while avoiding harmful over-treatment (e.g., avoid excessive aggressive mobilization causing injury).</li>
      <li><strong>Justice:</strong> equitable access to rehab services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Decision framework for conflicts:</strong> identify stakeholders, list ethical principles in tension, gather facts, consider legal obligations, consult colleagues/ethics committee, choose least harmful option with documented justification.</p>

    <p><strong>Example scenario:</strong> A patient refuses a painful but potentially beneficial exercise — respect autonomy, re-explain benefits/risks, seek compromise (modify intensity), document discussion.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Biomedical principles provide a practical framework for everyday clinical decisions, protect patient rights, and guide professional conduct.</p>
